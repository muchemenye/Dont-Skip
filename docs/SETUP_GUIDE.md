## üéØ Finding Your Balance

### Week 1: Establish Baseline

- Set very achievable workout requirements
- Focus on building the habit, not intensity
- Use honor system for verification
- Adjust ratios based on your natural rhythm

### Week 2-3: Optimize Ratios

- Track when you naturally want to take breaks
- Adjust workout-to-coding ratios
- Experiment with different workout types
- Fine-tune daily limits

### Week 4+: Advanced Features

- Add photo verification
- Set up team challenges
- Integrate with fitness trackers
- Optimize for your peak productivity hours

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Workspace vs User Settings

- **User settings**: Apply to all projects (`~/.vscode/settings.json`)
- **Workspace settings**: Project-specific (`.vscode/settings.json`)
- Workspace settings override user settings

### Custom Workout Types

Create workout types that match your routine:

```json
{
  "workoutTypes": [
    { "name": "Yoga Flow", "minDuration": 20, "codingHours": 4 },
    { "name": "Rock Climbing", "minDuration": 60, "codingHours": 10 },
    { "name": "Dog Walk", "minDuration": 10, "codingHours": 2 },
    { "name": "Bike Commute", "minDuration": 25, "codingHours": 5 }
  ]
}
```

### Time Zone Considerations

- Daily limits reset at local midnight
- Credit expiry uses local time
- Emergency unlock duration is real-time

## üö® Emergency Unlock Guidelines

### When to Use Emergency Unlock

‚úÖ **Appropriate uses:**

- Production bug that needs immediate fix
- Client demo in 10 minutes
- Critical deadline with no time for workout
- Security vulnerability discovered

‚ùå **Avoid using for:**

- Regular coding sessions
- "I don't feel like working out"
- Non-urgent feature development
- Code reviews or documentation

### Emergency Best Practices

1. **Use sparingly** - Aim for < 1 per week
2. **Pay it back** - Do a workout soon after emergency use
3. **Reflect** - Consider if better planning could avoid emergencies
4. **Team communication** - Let teammates know about urgent situations

## üì± Future iOS App Integration

### Coming Soon

- Automatic workout detection via Apple Watch
- GPS tracking for runs/walks
- Photo verification with timestamps
- Social features and team challenges
- Integration with popular fitness apps

### Preparing for iOS App

- Start building workout habits now
- Use consistent workout naming
- Track your preferred workout types
- Build accountability with teammates

## ü§ù Team Setup

### For Team Leads

1. **Set team standards** in workspace settings
2. **Communicate the why** - health and productivity benefits
3. **Lead by example** - share your workout completions
4. **Be flexible** - allow individual customization within guidelines
5. **Celebrate wins** - acknowledge consistent exercisers

### For Team Members

1. **Respect the system** - don't abuse emergency unlock
2. **Share accountability** - workout buddy system
3. **Customize thoughtfully** - find what works for your schedule
4. **Give feedback** - help improve team settings

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working

1. Check if extension is activated (status bar visible)
2. Restart VSCode
3. Check for extension updates
4. Reset data if needed: `Cmd+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Reset All Data"

### Credits Not Updating

1. Verify workout was recorded successfully
2. Check credit expiry dates
3. Ensure daily limits aren't exceeded
4. Look for error messages in VSCode output

### Lockout Too Aggressive

1. Increase workout-to-coding ratios
2. Extend credit rollover days
3. Raise daily coding limits
4. Add more workout types with lower requirements
