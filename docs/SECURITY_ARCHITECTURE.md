# Security Architecture

## Overview

The Workout Lockout system uses a secure three-tier architecture with comprehensive security measures at each layer.

## Architecture Components

```
Mobile App ↔ Backend API ↔ VSCode Extension
     ↓           ↓              ↓
HealthKit/   MongoDB/Redis   Local Cache
Google Fit   + Encryption    + Tokens
```

## Security Measures

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

### 3. API Security

**Rate Limiting:**

- Minimal base images (Alpine Linux)
- Security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Resource limits and health checks

**Network Security:**

- Reverse proxy with Nginx
- SSL/TLS termination
- DDoS protection
- IP whitelisting for admin endpoints

### 6. Privacy Protection

**Data Minimization:**

- Only collect necessary fitness data

- **NEW: No PII in logs or error messages (verified with security tests)**
- **NEW: Sanitized API request logging without sensitive data**
- Secure data deletion on account termination
- **NEW: Comprehensive state clearing on logout across all platforms**

### 7. VS Code Extension Security

**Authentication Security:**

- **NEW: Secure token storage in VS Code global state**
- **NEW: Session validation with automatic expiration**
- **NEW: Comprehensive logout with state clearing**
- **NEW: Protection against token theft**

**Input Security:**

- **NEW: Enhanced email validation with injection prevention**
- **NEW: Advanced password validation (8+ chars, complexity requirements)**
- **NEW: Protection against common weak passwords**
- **NEW: Input length limits and character filtering**

**State Management Security:**

- **NEW: Secure device ID generation**
- **NEW: Automatic cleanup of expired sessions**

## Security Best Practices

### Environment Configuration

```bash
# Strong JWT secret (256-bit minimum)
JWT_SECRET=your-cryptographically-secure-secret-here

# Encryption key for sensitive data
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-encryption-key-here

# Database security
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://username:password@host:port/database?ssl=true
REDIS_URL=rediss://username:password@host:port

# CORS security
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-domain.com,vscode-webview://*
```

### Deployment Security

1. **Secrets Management:**

   - Use environment variables for all secrets
   - Rotate keys regularly (quarterly recommended)
   - Use secret management services (AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)

2. **Monitoring & Logging:**

   - Comprehensive audit logging
   - Real-time security monitoring
   - Automated threat detection
   - Log retention policies

3. **Backup Security:**
   - Encrypted database backups
